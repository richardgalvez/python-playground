You are tasked with building a note management system that allows users to create, retrieve, list, and delete notes. The notes must be stored persistently in a local JSON file (notes.json) and include metadata.

Implement the class NoteManager with the following methods:

```python
def create_note(self, title: str, content: str) -> None:
    """
    Saves a new note with a title, content, and timestamp. Titles must be unique.
    """

def get_note(self, title: str) -> dict:
    """
    Returns a note's details by its title.
    """

def delete_note(self, title: str) -> None:
    """
    Removes a note from storage based on its title.
    """

def list_notes(self) -> list[str]:
    """
    Lists the titles of all existing notes.
    """
```

# 📝 Requirements
Each note must include:

- A title (must be unique, non-empty)

- A content body

- A timestamp (use datetime.datetime.now().isoformat())

- Notes must be persisted to a local file (notes.json) in JSON format.

- Raise ValueError if title or content is empty.

- Raise KeyError if attempting to get/delete a note that doesn't exist.

- The system should handle file I/O errors gracefully on load/save.

- When creating a note, if the title already exists, raise a ValueError.

# 💡 Examples

```python
nm = NoteManager()

nm.create_note("Meeting Notes", "Discussed project deadlines.")
nm.get_note("Meeting Notes")
# Returns: {'title': 'Meeting Notes', 'content': 'Discussed project deadlines.', 'timestamp': '2025-04-16T18:25:43'}

nm.list_notes()
# Returns: ['Meeting Notes']

nm.delete_note("Meeting Notes")
nm.get_note("Meeting Notes")  # Raises KeyError
```
