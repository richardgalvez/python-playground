You are tasked with building a web-based trivia quiz app. This app will walk users through a multiple-choice quiz, question by question, and display their score and detailed results at the end.

This will give you experience with **stateful user interactions**, **dynamic HTML rendering**, 
and **multi-step flows** — all key features in interactive web apps.

## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **Flask** (backend and routing)

- **HTML with Jinja2 templates** (for rendering questions and results)

- **Flask session** (for tracking user progress and answers)

## 📝 Functional Requirements

```plaintext
Implement the following Flask routes:

GET  /               → Welcome screen with a "Start Quiz" button
GET  /quiz           → Displays the current question (one at a time) with a form
POST /quiz           → Submits an answer, updates progress, and loads next question
GET  /results        → Displays the user's total score + detailed review
```

## 📚 Quiz Data

Use a list of **5 fixed trivia questions**

- Each question should have:

    - `question_text`: str

    - `options`: list of 4 answer strings

    - `correct_option_index`: int (0-based index for the correct answer)

- Questions can be stored as a list in Python, or loaded from a `questions.json` file

## 🎯 Core Logic

- Users see **one question per page**

- When they select an answer and submit, store it in **Flask’s session**

- Move to the **next question automatically** on submission

- If the user completes all questions, redirect to `/results`

 - On `/results`, show:

    - Total score

    - For each question:
    
        - The question

        - What they answered

        - Whether it was correct or not
        
        - The correct answer

## ✅ Input Validation & Flow Rules

- Questions must be answered in sequence

- Users cannot skip ahead or visit /results early

- If they refresh during the quiz, it resumes at the current question

- Prevent quiz reset unless user finishes or returns to homepage

## 🖼️ HTML Requirements

Each view should be rendered using an HTML template with Jinja:

###  `/`

- Welcome message

- “Start Quiz” button → POST or redirect to /quiz

### `/quiz`

- Displays:

    - Current question

    - A form with 4 radio buttons for answer options

    - A “Submit” button
    
- The selected answer is sent via POST

### `/results`

- Displays:

    - Final score (e.g. "You got 4/5 correct!")

    - A review of each question with:

        - The original question

        - The user’s answer

        - The correct answer

        - Visual indicator of correct/incorrect (✓ or ✗)

## 💡 Example Flow

```yaml
[ / ]
Welcome to the Quiz!
[ Start Quiz ]

→

[ /quiz ]
Q2: What is the capital of France?
( ) Berlin
( ) Madrid
( ) Paris ←
( ) Rome
[ Submit ]

→

[ /results ]
✅ Q1: What is 2 + 2?
Your answer: 4

❌ Q2: Capital of Italy
Your answer: Madrid
Correct: Rome

Score: 4 out of 5
```
