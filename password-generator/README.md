You are tasked with building a password generator system for a basic application. The application must generate secure passwords for users upon request.

Implement the class `PasswordGenerator` with the following method:

```python
def generate_password(self, length: int) -> str:
    """
    Generates a password of the specified length following certain security rules.
    """
```

## 📝 Requirements

- The generated password **must** contain:
  - At least one lowercase letter.
  - At least one uppercase letter.
  - At least one digit.
  - At least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()-_=+`).
- The order of characters should be **randomized**.
- If the length is **less than 4**, raise a `ValueError` explaining that the password cannot meet complexity rules.
- If the length is greater than 128, raise a `ValueError` stating it exceeds recommended secure length.
- All characters in the password must be randomly chosen from allowed sets.
- Duplicate characters **are allowed**.

### 💡 Examples

```python
pg = PasswordGenerator()
pg.generate_password(10)  # returns something like "A1!hfjK3@z"
pg.generate_password(3)   # raises ValueError
```
