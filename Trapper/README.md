**Difficulty:** Intermediate++ to Advanced

**Tags:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Authentication, HTML Forms, Jinja2, Docker Compose, SQLAlchemy, Full Stack, Web App


**Notes**:

- bcrypt set to 4.0.1 due to the warning issues regarding missing '__about__'.

## 🧠 Project Goal

Build a **containerized, full-stack web app** for tracking software issues or bug reports. Users will be able to **register, log in, create and resolve issues**, and view their own reports via a clean HTML interface.

This is a **realistic end-to-end web system** involving:

- API routing

- Database modeling

- Session-based user authentication

- Templated HTML rendering

- Secure password handling

- Dockerized service deployment

## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** (web framework, routing, form handling)

- **Jinja2 Templates + HTML + Bootstrap** (basic frontend)

- **PostgreSQL** (database)

- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM)

- **Pydantic** (validation)

- **Passlib / bcrypt** (password hashing)

- **Docker + Docker Compose** (to run API + DB in containers)

## 📝 Functional Requirements

### User Authentication

- **GET /register** → Registration form

- **POST /register** → Create user account

- **GET /login** → Login form

- **POST /login** → Authenticate user and start session

- **GET /logout** → End session and redirect to homepage

- Store user sessions using **signed cookies or dependency injection**

## Issue Management

- **GET /** → Homepage with all issues for the logged-in user

- **GET /report** → New issue form

- **POST /report** → Create new issue for current user

- **GET /issues/{id}** → View issue detail page

- **POST /issues/{id}/resolve** → Mark an issue as resolved

- All actions must be **scoped to the current user**

## 🗃️ Database Models

### User

- `id`: auto-increment

- `username`: str (unique, required)

- `hashed_password`: str (store securely with hashing)

- `created_at`: datetime

### Issue

- `id`: auto-increment

- `title`: str (required)

- `description`: str (required)

- `priority`: str (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

- `status`: str (`open`, `resolved`, default: `open`)

- `user_id`: foreign key to `User`

- `created_at`: datetime

## 📦 Docker Setup

Use **Docker Compose** to spin up:

- FastAPI backend (`app` service)

- PostgreSQL database (`db` service)

### File Requirements

- `Dockerfile` for building the FastAPI app

- `docker-compose.yaml` with app + db config

- `.env` for config secrets and DB connection string

- On container startup, app must auto-connect and create tables

## 🖼️ HTML Templates

### `/login` and `/register`

- Forms with username/password

- Redirect on success or show error

### `/` (Dashboard)

- List of user’s issues:

    - Title, priority, status

    - “View” and “Resolve” actions

`/report`

- Form to create new issue

`/issues/{id}`

- Full issue detail with resolve option if still open

## ✅ Validation & Rules

- Passwords must be hashed — never stored in plain text

- Only logged-in users can access issue-related routes

- Users cannot see or modify each other’s issues

- All templates must reflect status and priority visually

- Invalid logins show errors (don’t crash)

## 💡 Example User Flow

```txt
1. User registers at /register  
2. Logs in via /login (session starts)  
3. Visits / and sees their open issues  
4. Reports a bug via /report  
5. Views the issue at /issues/{id}  
6. Resolves it via a button → /issues/{id}/resolve  
7. Logs out via /logout
```

## 💻 This Project Helps You Practice:

- Session-based authentication with password hashing

- Secure route protection (`@authenticated`)

- Modeling user-owned resources

- Creating a fully containerized dev environment

- Building frontend views from backend state

- Deploying FastAPI + Postgres together in a real setup
